# dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo. All of my custom configuration is in here. I use [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage these config files, hence the funky file layout. I used chezmoi for a while, but it eventually become more annoying than useful, as well as it wasn't working for a fresh install on my new laptop, so I swapped back to just stow. These are in progress as I migrate everything back, namely the install script to install all of the dotfiles.
